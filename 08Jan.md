# Language, Mind and the Brain
## Structure and Function of the Brain
The brain consists of 100 billion neurons and billions of fibres connecting them. The brain's surface, or the cortex, consists of "grey matter."  
The brain consists of two hemispheres, connected by a bundle called the corpus callosum. Each hemisphere executes (or tends to) a roughly distinct set of functions, *i.e.,* brain function is *lateralized*.  
The functioning of the brain is also *contralateral* – each side of the brain controls the opposite side of the body.

Joseph Gall, in the early 19th century, proposed a pseudo-scientific theory of localization based on examining skull bumps. This was called phrenology. While phrenology itself is now discredited, the now prevalent idea of localization of brain function had its origin in this theory.

The left hemisphere is understood to handle logical ability, language, and reasoning, while the right hemisphere is more dominant in tasks related to intuition, creativity and relationships, but also contributes to language function.  
The empirical evidence for lateralization comes from two main sources: disorders (aphasia and acquired dyslexia) and experiments (split-brains, brain plasticity and certain writing systems).  
The effects of aphasia differ according to the affected area; for example, Broca's aphasia (or agrammatic aphasia), affecting the frontal lobe in the left hemisphere, causes difficulty with function words, sentence production, and inflectional suffixes.
