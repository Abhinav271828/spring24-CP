# Introduction
## Speech Signal
Speech comprehension depends on articulatory properties perceived by the eyes. The three features of the signal that speech perception must deal with are:

* continuous
* pipelined
* variable
    - among speakers
    - within speakers
    - ambient noise

The motor theory of speech comprehension, outlined by Liberman and Mattingley in 1985, postulates that
* gestrues constitute the fundamental unit of speech perception
* gestural plan instructs articulator movement, producing speech
* decoding gestures lets the listener reconstruct the utterance
